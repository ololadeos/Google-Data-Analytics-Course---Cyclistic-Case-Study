# Google-Data-Analytics-Course---Cyclistic-Case-Study
This project was the last course in the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera and provided the opportunity to make use of the knowledge gained and practice the new skills acquired on real data. 

As my first data analysis project, it was a bit overwhelming at first as I did not really know where to start; I kept on reading the document over and over again, taking notes, having an idea of the information I needed to answer the business task but was a bit blocked on how to begin to tackle the large dataset I had to work with. 

My intentions were:
**Phase 1:** Complete the case study using a sample data size – I started with this method to help myself get a hang of managing data and getting insights from said data. (Completed September 14th, 2025). 
**Phase 2:** Complete the case study using all the data using SQL and visualising on Tableau (Completed December 12th, 2025). 
**Phase 3:** Compare the insights from Phases 1 and 2 to look at how using sample size data can affect results. 


**CASE STUDY BACKGROUND**
Cyclistic is bike-share company based in Chicago. The director of marketing believes that the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. The marketing team has been tasked with understanding how casual riders and annual members differ in their use of the bike-shares and from these insights, will design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 
Scenario: I am a junior data analyst on the marketing team, and my specific task is to answer the question: “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”

**Business Task:**
The business task is to decipher how Casual Riders and Annual Members use Cyclistic differently to provide the marketing team with information that will help drive their tactics. 
Data Sources used: The data used for this analysis project is found here: Cyclistic and the time period chosen was: August 2024 – July 2025 (12 months of Data). The data was made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.  

**Casual Riders:** Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes
**Annual Members:** Customers who purchase annual memberships

**Phase 1** – Completing the case study using a sample data size. 
I downloaded 12 months of data from source and did a quick scan of the csv files; each file had at least 150,000 rows of data. As this was my first project, I had decided to use spreadsheets (Excel specifically) to ease me into data analysis. To get insights from the year, I needed to combine all twelve data files. I attempted this on Excel using Power Query but there were more rows than are possible to have in Excel. 
For each month’s file, I calculated the number of entries that would give me 99% confidence level and 1% margin of error.
